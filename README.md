# Tab Bootstrap Template
## Free Bootstrap Tab Template
We have seen tabs with definite boundaries in all the previous bootstrap tab. One of the advantages of the borderless design is you can easily adjust the design. In the default design, the designer has used only texts for the tabs. The texts are made bolder and bigger for better readability and legibility even on small screen devices. If you are looking for a tabbed widget to use on your website, this one will be a perfect choice. The simple minimal design of the wizard makes it easily blend with other elements on the website or you can even use it in full page design.
